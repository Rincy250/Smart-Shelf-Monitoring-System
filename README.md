# Smart-Shelf-Monitoring-System
A comprehensive smart shelf monitoring system that combines hardware sensors, computer vision, and AI to track inventory, detect theft, and monitor shelf conditions in real-time

## Project Overview
This project consists of three main components:

1.Frontend: React-based web application for real-time monitoring and management

2.Backend: Flask server handling data processing and AI integration

3.Hardware: Arduino-based sensor system with ESP32-CAM for computer vision

## Features

- Real-time inventory tracking using ultrasonic and force sensors
- Computer vision-based product placement monitoring  
- AI-powered theft detection and alert system  
- Sales tracking and analytics  
- Real-time alerts for potential thefts and misplacements  
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring shelf status  

## Tech Stack

### FrontEnd

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios for API communication
- React Router for navigation

### BackEnd

- Flask
- Google Gemini AI for image analysis
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- RESTful API endpoints

### HardWare
